![Demo](/WorkoutTimer_demo.PNG)

## Implementation and Run Details
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I used `yarn` as the package manager. `npm` works as well.

```bash

#clone repo
git clone https://github.com/jkling2/workout-timer.git
cd workout-timer

#download dependencies
yarn
#This downloades the necessary dependencies into the following folder: `node-modules`.

```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!


### `yarn deploy`

Once the app was built, it can be deployed to GitHub Pages.<br />
It takes the bundled React app from the `build` folder and deploys it to the specified homepage: [https://jkling2.github.io/workout-timer/].
